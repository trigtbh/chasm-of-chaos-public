# Chasm of Chaos

**This repository is a public-facing repository of the first project I did for my senior-year CS class: a recreation of the dungeon game from [Riptide](https://github.com/trigtbh/riptide-public), one of my earlier projects.**

The **Chasm of Chaos** is a dungeon that can only be described by one word: *unpredictable*.

Its labyrinth-like floors are seemingly randomized, with rooms connected by a series of twisting corridors and winding tunnels.

Brave adventurers who dare to enter are told that fame, fortune, and glory await them inside.
However, *none have made it out alive...*

Think you're up for the challenge?
